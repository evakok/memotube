# MemoTube
MemoTube is a video player app that allows users to take notes while they are watching a video. Users can watch a video from their tablet or phone and take a note over it with transient gestures. When the user put down two fingers the note session begins and the video is paused. There is a change at the opacity of the view to be easier to take the note. When the user lift off the fingers the note is saved as a bookmark and the video starts to play again. At the bookmark menu they can view all the notes they have take for the playing video and if they click on one of them they can show it on top of the video. Also, users have the ability to change the color and the width of their pen during their writing. 

Some really helpful libraries that have been used for the implementation of this app were:
* [ExoPlayer](https://google.github.io/ExoPlayer/) - The Media Player of the app
* [AndroidDraw](https://github.com/divyanshub024/AndroidDraw) - Taking notes
