# MemoTube
MemoTube is a video player app that allows users to take notes while they are watching a video.
It works on Android version 4.4 (Kitkat) or above. It was designed for and tested on 9.6 inch tablet(Samsung Galaxy Tab E SM-T560).

# How to use

To start the note-taking mode, place your two non-dominant fingers on the screen.
